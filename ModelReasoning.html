<p class="p2">My strategy for creating this problem involved a three-step process. My first step was to look at the data. A quick glance at the data revealed large amounts of missing information. I then removed all attributes that had missing data. I then looked at the remaining attributes and removed the index and user name attribute as both failed to provide relevant data on exercises. I also removed all data with a near zero variance. The second step involved deciding on which model to use. I decided to use boosting with trees with preprocessing. The preprocessing allowed me to reduce the number of attributes by a greater degree. I have found I have a better understanding of how models based on trees work when compared to other models. Boosting also offers a direct method of improving my model without increasing the work I have to do. The final step of my method was to confirm my model worked. I had set aside some data to use to validate my training dataâ€™s accuracy. The testing data I had set aside had a very nice accuracy (greater than 99 percent) when run on my model. After building my model and confirming on separate test data that the model was accurate, I used my model on the 20 test cases.</p>
